			<li>Alert purposes to provide pertinent information about how a person can receive and access the services that they are entitled to 
			with regard to their basic needs/rights and that of their families.
			</li>
			<li>Alert purposes to empower welfare recipients and low-income earners with the necessary education and awareness techniques 
			that they need to alleviate the fear that surrounds them for having to (through no fault of their own) depend on full/partial government assistance.
			</li>
			<li>
			Alert purposes to encourage welfare recipients and low-income earners to organize small sub groups in their areas. These groups would then 
			share with our group from time to time to form a network of people getting their rights addressed.
			</li>
			<li>Alert purposes to educating the public and lobbying government to improve the living conditions of the poor in PEI.
