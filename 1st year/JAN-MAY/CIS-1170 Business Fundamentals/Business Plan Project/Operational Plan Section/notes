-What has been done to date to get business operational
-What still needs to be done
	Subsection: Risks
-Industry Association MemberShip
-Suppliers
-Quality Control


In this section, describe how your product or service will be made, and identify the problems that may occur in the production process.

Then show your awareness of your industry's standards and regulations by telling which industry organizations you are already a member of and/or which organizations you plan to join, and telling what steps you've taken to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to your industry.	

Explain who your suppliers are and their prices, terms, and conditions. Describe what alternative arrangements you have made or will make if these suppliers let you down.

Explain the quality control measures that you've set up or are going to establish.

When you're writing this section of the operating plan for the business plan, start by explaining what you've done "to date" to get the business operational, followed by an explanation of what still needs to be done. Follow this with a subsection titled "Risks" that outlines the potential problems that may interfere with the production process and what you're going to do to negate these risks. The rest of the development stage part of the operating plan will be divided into subsections such as "Industry Association Membership", "Suppliers" and "Quality Control".



Production Process section:

-General day to day ops
-Physical Plant / Location
-Equipment
-Assets
-Special Requirements
-Materials
-Production ( replace with Services ? )
-Inventory
-Feasibility
-Cost

Subsection 1: Day to day operations
	Rules of Conduct
Subsection 2: Physical Location
Subsection 3: Equipment
	Equipment necessary, how much of it, worth and cost, any financing
	arrangements
Subsection 4: Assets
Subsection 5: Special Requirements
	Fitness / Health Club Insurance
Subsection 8: Inventory
Subsection 9: Feasibility
Subsection 10: Cost
	

	General: Do an outline of your business' day to day operations, such as the hours of operation, and the days the business will be open. If the business is seasonal, be sure to say so.

	The physical plant: What type of premises are they and what is the size and location? If it's applicable, include drawings of the building, copies of lease agreements, and/or recent real estate appraisals. You need to show how much the land or buildings required for your business operations are worth, and tell why they're important to your proposed business.
	
	Equipment: The same goes for equipment. Besides describing the equipment necessary and how much of it you need, you also need to include its worth and cost, and explain any financing arrangements.	

	Assets: Make a list of your assets, such as land, buildings, inventory, furniture, equipment and vehicles. Include legal descriptions and the worth of each asset.

	Special requirements: If your business has any special requirements, such as water or power needs, ventilation, drainage, etc., provide the details in your operating plan - as well as what you've done to secure the necessary permissions, such as zoning approvals.

	Materials: Tell where you're going to get the materials you need to produce your product or service, and explain what terms you've negotiated with suppliers.

	Production: Explain how long it takes to produce a unit, and when you'll be able to start producing your product or service. Include factors that may affect the time frame of production and how you'll deal with potential problems such as rush orders.

	Inventory: Explain how you'll keep track of inventory.

	Feasibility: Describe any product testing, price testing, or prototype testing that you've done on your product or service.

	Cost: Give details of product cost estimates.



*** Keeping focused on the bottom line will help you organize this part of the business plan; 
*** think of the operating plan as an outline of the capital and expense requirements your business will need to operate from day to day.


SIMILARITIES TO GYM AND GAMING

http://www.geekfitness.net/tag/mmo-fitness/

In the Gym

I figure out what I want to do before I get there. (Plan my workout)
I research equipment I want to use. (The internet is awesome!)
I set aside a reasonable amount of time to be in gym. (30 mins is enough for me)
I familiarize myself with the gym prior to working out. (Most gyms have a free orientation briefing)
I focus on what I need to do. (Like a horse with blinders on looking at a carrot hanging from a stick 2 inches from my nose)
I bring my appropriate gear. (workout clothes and music)
I’m polite to others working out.
I do not look at other people working out. (It’s rude to stare even if you’re learning. Just use a quick glance if you need a pointer.)
I clean equipment and put away anything I’ve used before I leave. (Sweat is disgusting and leaving weights around the gym can be a hazard to yourself and others.)
I expect to be tired and in pain for a couple days afterwards. (Don’t try to do everything in one day.)
In the Game

I read up on strategies.
I research the best weapons and builds I can use for the dungeon.
I set up raid times with my family so I can commit to it.
I test out my build and double check all the possible drops I can get so I don’t fumble around wondering if a drop is an upgrade or not.
I go to the bathroom and wait outside the dungeon ready to go.
I get my headset on, make sure my gear is at 100%, and get the appropriate extras I need to win.
I only talk or type when I need to and I say please a lot.
I don’t roll on gear just to get something and I don’t mess around.
I say thank you when I leave the group and clean up around my computer.
Work is going to suck the next day. I stayed up too late raiding.
As you can see, games and the gym are the same as long as you can prepare yourself mentally beforehand. All that is fine and dandy in theory, but what about the real mental blocks?
