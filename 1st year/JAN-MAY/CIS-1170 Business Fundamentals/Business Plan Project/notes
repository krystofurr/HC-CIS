IDEAS:
	on the go exergaming ( portable systems with class trainer for parties, birthdays, etc )
	Athletic trainers use the facility for specific rehabilitation of injured athletes
	


Arguments are made that exergames align with the notion that videogames are very intrinsically motivating, offering children the "5C's" of control, challenge, curiousity, creativity, and constant feedback (Hinson, 2001)



minimum 400 lockable square feet be available as in a dedicated facility

noise in the facility at peak times

type of flooring

acoustical design--plans to add sound absorbing panels

location of electrical outlets

training session areas

maintenance of techology systems ( technical support individuals )
	minor repair or troubleshooting

Who will be using the facility? What time of day will it be used? Can it be accessible during physical education classes and easily transitioned with other physical activities? Will it be accessed after hours and outside of school time? Is it used for academic classes, recreational programming, community participation, and/or research?
