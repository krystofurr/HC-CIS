1.	What is the difference between criminal law and civil law?

3.	What is a policy? How does it differ from a law?

A policy is a set of ground rules that describe acceptable

5.	What is due care? Why would an organization want to make sure it exercises due care in its usual course of operations?

Due care is a organizational standard where it makes sure that every employee knows what type of behaviour is acceptable or unacceptable.  They also ensure that they know the repercussions of their actions whether illegal or unethical. 

An organization would want to make sure it exercises due care in its usual course of operations because if they did not, then the organization itself can be held financially responsible for their employees unethical or illegal actions.
