Rank the inventoried and classified data assigning a number to each CIA column 
according to the financial impact it would have 
and 
how much trust (integrity) you place in the data as being reliable to the business, if compromised and not being available for a period of time. 


Understand that any data has a financial impact to a business if Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability is compromised and each should have a number assigned. 



As an aspiring information security professional, you will have a key role to play in risk management. It is the responsibility of an organization’s general management to structure the IT and information security functions to defend the organization’s information assets—

information and data, hardware, software, procedures, networks, and people. 


Confidentiality:

Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy. Measures undertaken to ensure confidentiality are designed to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people, while making sure that the right people can in fact get it: Access must be restricted to those authorized to view the data in question.

Integrity:

Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure that data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality).

Availability: 

Availability is best ensured by rigorously maintaining all hardware, performing hardware repairs immediately when needed and maintaining a correctly functioning operating system environment that is free of software conflicts.
