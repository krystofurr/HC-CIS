CIS1290 Information Security Fundamentals
SME Project  -  15 Minute Max presentation 

The SME (Subject Matter Expert) project is an individual project and the material should be targeted to IT ‘Peers’. You will assume your audience has a similar level of understanding of IT and general Security topics as you. This project is premised on the grounds that you will become a SME in one of the chosen topic in the list (or other topic as approved by instructor). As SME, you will research your chosen topic thoroughly. This will mean you must cite at least one (1) published article (ERIC for example) as part of your research. This is separate from any internet sources you may use. The College library can assist you if you haven’t done any such research before and they have subscriptions to such published articles through databases such as ERIC. This is all available online. You may use published in-print books as a resource as well. Let me know if you need assistance getting help from the library.
The deliverables for this project is the presentation of your topic, an associated handout, and a Resources/References page. You have some flexibility in the style of presentation; you may discuss this with your instructor. Examples of possible styles are: formal (suit and tie in person presentation), casual presentation in person, Youtube internet presentation etc. As well, distance students might want to consider web cam or video tape or similar as well as audio and conference call styles. The handout may be a set of Powerpoint slides, an informal report, or as the case may be, an alternate media (video, audio, etc.)... Note: A handout means participants have something to take away with them and/or refer to during & after the presentation. 

We will post more info on this as questions arise. This will be due towards the end of the course and the presentations will be scheduled and posted in SAM.
