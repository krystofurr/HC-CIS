QUESTIONS:
	For the references sheet, should this be a physical sheet handed in or can it be part of 	the powerpoint presentation as a hidden slide ( meaning it's not shown during the 	 	 presentation )?

	The handout itself can be the powerpoint?

	Are we allowed a video in the presentation?

INTRO
================================================

This presentation will cover 

WHAT IS A PASSWORD MANAGER
=================================================

- write all their passwords down on a piece of paper or stick it notes over top of a monitor
- use the same password for both their personal and work accounts. 

------

- A password manager is a software application that helps a user store and organize passwords. 

- Also called a password vault or virtual safe

- Core functionality of a password manager is to securely store large collections of passwords

- Usually store passwords encrypted, requiring the user to create a master password; a single, ideally very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database.

- Some password managers store passwords on the user's computer, whereas others store data in the cloud. 

- Many provide additional features such as form filling and password generation.





HOW THEY WORK?
=================================================

-stores all passwords in one central location ( database on computer or mobile device, or in the cloud ). CAN BE UNENCRYPTED OR ENCRYPTED

-secured by a single master password ( which should be strong because it's access to your collection of passwords! ).  This may deter people from using password managers

-can integrate into your browser ( mobile devices 


WHO USES THEM?
=================================================

Normal user and/or Enterprise class

ADVANTAGES / DISADVANTAGES
=================================================

	Different types of password managers may have different advantages and disadvantages compared to each other based on their types.  Below are some generalized listings as well as some specifics to different types

ADV
---

SHORT LIST
---
-ease of use 
-cross platform
-automated updates of new site password creation
-easily incorported into most software
-additional features besides password management
-defense against phishing / pharming
-protection against keystroke logging malware


	they are easily incorporated in most software using APIs available in many software 	products, they require no extensive computer/server modifications, and that users are already familiar with the use of passwords

many provide additional features such as form filling[1] and password generation.[2]

Password managers can also be used as a defense against phishing and pharming. Unlike human beings, a password manager program can also incorporate an automated login script that first compares the current site's URL to the stored site's URL. If the two don't match then the password manager does not automatically fill in the login fields. This is intended as a safeguard against visual imitations and look-alike websites.

Password managers can protect against keyloggers or keystroke logging malware. When using a multi-factor authentication password manager that automatically fills in logon fields, the user does not have to type any user names or passwords for the keylogger to pick up.

-ease of use. you don't have to remember your collection of passwords.  Only a single password!

-As you update your own password information on a given site, the manager can update it in it's own database system

DISADV
---

SHORT LIST
---

-cannot protect against man-in-the-browser attacks
-compromised master password
-master password is discovered by keystroke logging malware

password managers cannot protect against Man-in-the-browser attacks, where malware on the user's device performs operations (e.g. on a banking website) while the user is logged in while hiding the malicious activity from the user.
Man in the browser attack is a proxy Trojan horse[1] that infects a web browser by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in browser security to modify web pages, modify transaction content or insert additional transactions, all in a completely covert fashion invisible to both the user and host web application. A MitB attack will be successful irrespective of whether security mechanisms such as SSL/PKI and/or two or three-factor Authentication solutions are in place.

Desktop password managers and browser based password managers are convenient; however, they often do not provide any protection for stored passwords. If the computer is on, it is possible for another individual to access the password manager and read the user's password. 

A compromised master password renders all of the protected passwords vulnerable. This demonstrates the inverse relation between usability and security: a single password may be more convenient (usable), but if compromised would render all of the held passwords compromised.

the master password may also be attacked and discovered using key logging or acoustic cryptanalysis

HISTORY LESSON
=================================================

First worked together developing integrated VoIP (voice over the Internet) and e-commerce technology at eStara, Inc. where they designed, built, launched the most widely deployed web-based 'Push to Talk', 'Call Tracking' and 'Click-to-Chat' services in the world.

Their clients included leading e-commerce and financial services brands like Amazon, HSBC, Dell, TD Canada Trust, American Express and Yahoo.
