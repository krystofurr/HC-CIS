A large Internet merchandise provider determines its shipping charges based on
the number of items purchased. As the number increases, the shipping charges
proportionally decrease. This is done to encourage more purchases. If a single
item is purchased the shipping charge is $2.99. When customers purchase
between 2 and 5 items, they are charged the initial $2.99 for the first item and
then $1.99 per item for the remaining items. For customers who purchase more
than 5 items but less than 15, they are charged the initial $2.99 for the first item,
$1.99 per item for items 2 through 5, and $1.49 per item for the remaining items.
If they purchase 15 or more items, they are charged the initial $2.99 for the first
item, $1.99 per item for items 2 through 5, and $1.49 per item for items 6
through 14 and then just $0.99 per item for the remaining items. Allow the user
to enter the number of items purchased. Display the shipping charges.
