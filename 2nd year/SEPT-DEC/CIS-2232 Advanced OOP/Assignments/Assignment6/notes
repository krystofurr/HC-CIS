In order to find out how many grades that the client needs to send, 
it would have to send a request for the number of grades before it
sends any grade values.

- Client asks web service for data on deliverables within it's system ( how many, name and weight, etc )
- Web Service will provide client data of all deliverables
- Client will enter grades for each deliverable and send data back to the web service
- Web service will accept the data, process the average, and return the value back to the client
- Client receives response and displays the value
